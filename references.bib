abstract="In this chapter, we go through the fundamentals of artificial neural networks and deep learning methods. We describe the inspiration for artificial neural networks and how the methods of deep learning are built. We define the activation function and its role in capturing nonlinear patterns in the input data. We explain the universal approximation theorem for understanding the power and limitation of these methods and describe the main topologies of artificial neural networks that play an important role in the successful implementation of these methods. We also describe loss functions (and their penalized versions) and give details about in which circumstances each of them should be used or preferred. In addition to the Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regularization methods, we provide details of the dropout and the early stopping methods. Finally, we provide the backpropagation method and illustrate it with two simple artificial neural networks.",

 abstract = {A natural extension of the simple leave-one-out cross validation (CV) method is to allow the deletion of more than one observations. In this article, several notions of the multifold cross validation (MCV) method have been discussed. In the context of variable selection under a linear regression model, we show that the delete-d MCV criterion is asymptotically equivalent to the well known FPE criterion. Two computationally more feasible methods, the r-fold cross validation and the repeated learning-testing criterion, are also studied. The performance of these criteria are compared with the simple leave-one-out cross validation method. Simulation results are obtained to gain some understanding on the small sample properties of these methods.},
